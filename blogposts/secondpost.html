    <desc hidden><p>The project&rsquo;s goal is to explore the capabilities of the Nao robot to identify objects, interact with it&rsquo;s environment, and expand on these functionalities applying them to other fields such as the identification and tracking of human body movement. Using the Nao in competitions like this provides a standard hardware set to ensure the competition lies only in the software created by the team. The NAO robot has also been used to interact with emotionally disturbed individuals in therapy. To be effective in this role strong tools for the robot to obtain a semblance of understanding of the world around it are necessary.<br>
