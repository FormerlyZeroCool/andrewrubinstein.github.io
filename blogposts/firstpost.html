    This paper will discuss the effective implementation of recursion iteratively with the use of stacks. This is necessary in computer science as modern computational models work based upon iterative computation, and cannot innately recurs. 
    <br>Recursion is defined as follows by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:
    <br>“The recursive functions are characterized by the process in virtue of which the value of a function for some argument is defined in terms of the value of that function for some other (in some appropriate sense “smaller”) arguments, as well as the values of certain other functions.”
