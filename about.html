                “Success consists of moving from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm.”  <br>
                -Often attributed to Winston Churchill <br>
                This is a quote that continues to help me to this day.<br><br>
                I'm 28 now, and I spent my early 20's working for an Israeli software company that developed a specialized system for the Diamond industry, that manages inventory,
                accounting, and some customer relationship management or CRM tasks. <br><br>
                The company gave me responsibilities that included Microsoft SQL business intelligence report development, sales, and implementation of the software for new clients; I learned all of this on the job.  <br><br>
                I traveled to countries around the world where I worked with clients to setup, troubleshoot the software, and build custom SSRS reports, keeping up with my tasks in the different time zones.  <br>
                I learned and I got to travel the world.<br><br>
                Yet one piece was missing.  
                Although I had honed many skills and built rapport with customers, I wanted education.  
                So, I decided I was ready to return to an academic environment.<br>
                I left my position in 2018 and enrolled at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. <br>
                During my time as a student at The Borough of Manhattan Community College(BMCC) I continued to build on my knowledge, gained new friends,<br> 
                and through that the opportunity to pursue an education and Columbia Univerity's School of General Studies<br>
                My time at Columbia so far has been a humbling one forcing me to double down on my efforts, and work harder than ever before in an academic environment.<br>
                It has been exactly what I hoped to find, a real challenge, and something that keeps me working to improve myself<br>
                I have also been working in both the professional and academic worlds during this time Assistant Teaching at BMCC, and freelancing as a developer, and SSRS reporter for former clients<br>
                In addition to all this I try to make as much time as I can for my family, and hobby projects, like a framework I am building to build interpreters<br>
                and transpilers by defining a set of tokens that define the words of the language via regex, or dictionary, a context free grammar to define the syntax of a language<br>
                and an attribute grammar to define the semantic rules of a given language to be interpreted or transpiled.<br>
                All of these are defined in their own language, and are bootstrapped using one another.<br><br>
                Today I am looking for internships in software development for the summer of 2022<br>
