          <h2>An Introduction to Me</h2>
          <p class="text">
            “Success consists of moving from failure to failure without a loss of enthusiasm.”  <br>
            - Often attributed to Winston Churchill <br>
            This quote continues to inspire me every day.<br><br>

            I'm Andrew Rubinstein, currently residing in Manhattan, NY. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Columbia University, with an anticipated graduation date of December 2025.<br><br>

            My professional journey began in my early 20s, working for an Israeli software company that developed a specialized system for the diamond industry. This system managed inventory, accounting, and customer relationship management (CRM) tasks. My responsibilities included Microsoft SQL business intelligence report development, sales, and software implementation for new clients. I traveled internationally to work with clients, setting up, troubleshooting the software, and building custom SSRS reports, all while managing tasks across different time zones. It was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to see the world.<br><br>

            However, I felt a crucial piece was missing: formal education. Thus, in 2018, I left my position and enrolled at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC). During my time at BMCC, I expanded my knowledge, made new friends, and gained the opportunity to pursue education at Columbia University's School of General Studies.<br><br>

            My time at Columbia has been humbling, pushing me to double down on my efforts and work harder than ever in an academic setting. Alongside my studies, I have been balancing professional and academic responsibilities, including assistant teaching at BMCC and freelancing as a developer and SSRS reporter for former clients.<br><br>

            Recently, I have been working as a Technical Project Manager and Mentor at the CUNY Research Foundation, where I organized an AI innovation Hackathon with over 100 participants, hosted Scrum-based Agile SDLC working sessions, and mentored students to build projects solving real-world problems.<br><br>

            Additionally, I am involved in machine learning research at ARISE Labs, Columbia University, focusing on concolic testing and symbolic execution of existing projects. My personal projects include developing a lexer generator in C++ and a graphing calculator app in JavaScript.<br><br>

            I am currently seeking internships in software development for the summer of 2025.<br><br>
