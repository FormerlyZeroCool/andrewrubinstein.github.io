This is necessary in computer science as modern computational models work based upon iterative computation, and cannot innately recurs.     <br>Recursion is defined as follows by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:    <br>“The recursive functions are characterized by the process in virtue of which the value of a function for some argument is defined in terms of the value of that function for some other (in some appropriate sense “smaller”) arguments, as well as the values of certain other functions.”    "},

Using the Nao in competitions like this provides a standard hardware set to ensure the competition lies only in the software created by the team. The NAO robot has also been used to interact with emotionally disturbed individuals in therapy. To be effective in this role strong tools for the robot to obtain a semblance of understanding of the world around it are necessary.<br>    </p>"}
